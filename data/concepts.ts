    id: '1',
    term: 'Perception–Action Coupling',
    simpleExplanation: 'Moving based on what you see, without thinking about it first.',
    feynmanDefinition: "We don't see, then think, then do. We see-do. Your eyes and your legs are talking behind your back. You don't build a 3D model in your head like a nerd; you just move because the light changed. It's like dodging a pigeon: you didn't calculate its trajectory, you just didn't want a face full of feathers.",
    iconName: 'Zap'
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    term: 'Affordances',
    simpleExplanation: 'The world isn’t made of things; it’s made of invitations to act.',
    feynmanDefinition: "A chair isn't a 'chair'—it's a 'sittable.' A ledge is a 'jumpable.' To a tired person, a flat rock is a bed. To a hungry person, a berry is an 'eatable.' The world is just a giant buffet of things you can do to it. Stop looking at nouns and start looking at possibilities.",
    iconName: 'Eye'
  },
  {
    id: '3',
    term: 'Representative Learning Design',
    simpleExplanation: 'Making practice look like the actual game so it’s not a waste of time.',
    feynmanDefinition: "Don't practice fake stuff. If it doesn't look like the game, it's a waste of time. Shooting at a static hoop without a defender is like learning to drive in a parked car. It feels productive, but you're just getting good at being useless. Keep the context or stay home.",
    iconName: 'Target'
  },
  {
    id: '4',
    term: 'Constraints-Led Approach (CLA)',
    simpleExplanation: 'Changing the rules so the player figures out the answer themselves.',
    feynmanDefinition: "Don't tell them the answer; change the environment so they find it. Want a kid to learn to dribble low? Put them in a room with a low ceiling. You aren't a teacher; you're a landscape architect. Build the maze so the only way out is the right way.",
    iconName: 'Lock'
  },
  {
    id: '5',
    term: 'Degeneracy',
    simpleExplanation: 'Having multiple ways to solve the same problem so you don’t get stuck.',
    feynmanDefinition: "A terrible name for a great thing. It means having backup plans. Can you score with your left? Your right? Off one foot? Good. It's not about one 'perfect' form; it's about having a toolkit so big that the situation can't surprise you.",
    iconName: 'Layers'
  },
  {
    id: '6',
    term: 'Self-Organization',
    simpleExplanation: 'Order happens automatically without a boss barking orders.',
    feynmanDefinition: "The smart guys think you need a boss to tell you what to do. This says you don't. Traffic circles work without stoplights. Birds flock without a captain. Your body figures out how to walk over rocks without your brain micromanaging every toe muscle. Relax and let the system work.",
    iconName: 'Cpu'
  },
  {
    id: '7',
    term: 'Functional Variability',
    simpleExplanation: 'Being slightly different every time is a feature, not a bug.',
    feynmanDefinition: "Robots repeat; humans adapt. If you do the exact same motion twice, you're a statue. The world changes—wind, grass, mood—so your movement has to change too. Being 'consistent' is for machines. Being 'functional' means being messy enough to succeed in a messy world.",
    iconName: 'Wind'
  },
  {
    id: '8',
    term: 'Exploration–Exploitation Balance',
    simpleExplanation: 'Trying new ways to move versus sticking with what already works.',
    feynmanDefinition: "Try new stuff vs. stick with what works. If you only 'exploit,' you become a predictable dinosaur. If you only 'explore,' you're a headless chicken. You need to flirt with disaster just enough to find a better way to win, then milk it until it stops working.",
    iconName: 'Compass'
  },
  {
    id: '9',
    term: 'Information–Movement Coupling',
    simpleExplanation: 'Moving based on real-time info, not a memory of what happened before.',
    feynmanDefinition: "Moving based on what you see right now, not what you memorized last Tuesday. You aren't playing a recorded tape in your head. You're dancing with the environment. If the defender moves, you move. If you stop looking, you stop knowing. Stay present or get burned.",
    iconName: 'Activity'
  },
  {
    id: '10',
    term: 'Skill as Adaptability',
    simpleExplanation: 'Skill isn’t a pretty technique; it’s being able to solve problems.',
    feynmanDefinition: "Skill isn't a textbook technique; it's solving problems. I don't care if your jump shot looks like a dying bird as long as the ball goes in when someone is screaming in your face. Technique is for the gym; adaptability is for the trophy.",
    iconName: 'Wrench'
  },
  {
    id: '11',
    term: 'Nonlinear Learning',
    simpleExplanation: 'Progress isn’t a straight line; it’s a messy zig-zag.',
    feynmanDefinition: "Progress isn't a straight line. It's messy. You'll be great today and trash tomorrow. That's not a failure; that's the system recalibrating. Learning usually looks like a heart attack on a monitor before it looks like mastery. Deal with it.",
    iconName: 'TrendingUp'
  },
  {
    id: '12',
    term: 'Task Simplification',
    simpleExplanation: 'Make the whole game easier instead of cutting it into dead pieces.',
    feynmanDefinition: "Make the whole game simpler, don't chop it into dead pieces. If you want to teach soccer, use a smaller ball or a bigger net. Don't make them stand in a line and kick a cone. A cone doesn't have a soul. Keep the game alive, just lower the volume.",
    iconName: 'Minimize'
  },
  {
    id: '13',
    term: 'Wayfinding in Sport',
    simpleExplanation: 'You aren’t following a map; you’re an explorer finding a path.',
    feynmanDefinition: "You aren't a GPS following a map; you're an explorer finding a path. There is no 'correct' route to the goal. You have to sniff out the openings, feel the gaps, and react to the terrain as it shifts. Stop looking for instructions and start looking for exits.",
    iconName: 'Map'
  },
  {
    id: '14',
    term: 'Timescales of Learning',
    simpleExplanation: 'The difference between looking good today and actually being good forever.',
    feynmanDefinition: "What happens now vs. what sticks forever. Doing well in practice is 'performance'—it's cheap. Actually changing how your brain talks to your legs is 'learning'—it's expensive and takes time. Don't brag about the practice; wait for the game.",
    iconName: 'Clock'
  },
  {
    id: '15',
    term: 'Attunement and Calibration',
    simpleExplanation: 'Learning to notice the right cues and adjusting your power to match.',
    feynmanDefinition: "Tuning your radio to the right station. Attunement is noticing that the defender's weight is on their left foot. Calibration is knowing exactly how much force you need to blow past them. It's about being in sync with the physics of the moment.",
    iconName: 'Radio'
  },
  {
    id: '16',
    term: 'Decision-Making as Emergent',
    simpleExplanation: 'You don’t "decide" things; the situation forces them out of you.',
    feynmanDefinition: "You didn't 'decide' that; the situation pulled it out of you. You don't have a boardroom meeting in your skull during a fast break. The gap opened, and you filled it. Good decisions are just you being well-coupled to the world.",
    iconName: 'Sparkles'
  },
  {
    id: '17',
    term: 'Role of Intentionality',
    simpleExplanation: 'What you want to do changes what you actually see.',
    feynmanDefinition: "What you want to do changes what you see. If you're looking for a pass, you don't see the open shot. Your brain filters the world based on your goals. Change your intent, and the world literally looks like a different place. Pick your filter wisely.",
    iconName: 'Brain'
  },
  {
    id: '18',
    term: 'Sociocultural Constraints',
    simpleExplanation: 'How your culture and friends shape the way you play.',
    feynmanDefinition: "Why kids in Rio play differently than kids in Toronto. Culture shapes the game. If everyone around you plays fast and loose, you will too. You aren't just an athlete; you're a product of your neighborhood. The environment is bigger than the gym.",
    iconName: 'Globe'
  },
  {
    id: '19',
    term: 'Creativity as Adaptation',
    simpleExplanation: 'Creativity isn’t showing off; it’s solving a weird problem in a weird way.',
    feynmanDefinition: "It's not 'showing off,' it's 'solving a weird problem in a weird way.' Creativity isn't something you do for Instagram; it's what happens when the normal way is blocked and you have to invent a new physics to survive. Desperation is the mother of the highlight reel.",
    iconName: 'Lightbulb'
  },
  {
    id: '20',
    term: 'Designing for Joy',
    simpleExplanation: 'If it’s boring, nobody learns. Make it fun or go home.',
    feynmanDefinition: "If it's boring, they won't learn. Pain isn't the only way to progress. If the task is fun, the 'self-organization' happens for free. If you treat your players like coal-mine workers, don't be surprised when they stop caring. Gamify everything or lose them.",
